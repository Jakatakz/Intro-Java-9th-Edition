/*
 * (Compute the greatest common divisor) Another solution for Listing 4.9 to find
the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: First find d to
be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2, ..., 2, or 1 is a
divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor is the greatest
common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter
two positive integers and displays the gcd.
